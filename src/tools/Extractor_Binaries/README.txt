Client data extraction helpers
==============================
This directory provides a few helper scripts which will extract maps for both
calculating maps positions using the *mangos* map tools built during the build
process.

Requirements
------------
You will need a working installation of the [World of Warcraft][1] client patched
to version 1.12.x.

Also, you will have to run a full build of *mangos* to create all map tools.

Instructions
------------
Copy the created map tools to the [World of Warcraft][1] installation directory,
namely the tools named:

* `map-extractor`
* `vmap-extractor`
* `mmap-extractor`

Then copy `ExtractResources.sh`, `MoveMapGen.sh` and `offmesh.txt` into the client
installation directory.

Now open a [git Bash shell][2], and change to the installation directory.

Execute `ExtractResources.sh`, and answer the questions asked by the tool to

* extract client database files, and maps (**required**).
* extract vmaps (**required**).
* extract movement maps (**optional**). Be aware that this process is very CPU
  intense, and depending on your CPU may take up to a half day to create all
  movement maps.

If you edit `offmesh.txt` to fix any issues with navigation meshes, you can rerun
`ExtractResources.sh` to rebuild movement maps.

Logging
-------
The helper scripts will log every step of the process. Both `map-tools.log`
and `map-tools_detailed.log` will provide the output generated by all map
tools.

If you extracted movement maps too, there will be additional logs available:
`mmap-generator.log`, and `mmap-generator_detailed.log`.
