== Welcome to ScriptDev2 ==

ScriptDev2 is a script library, an extention of the scripting capabilities
that comes with MaNGOS (http://www.getmangos.eu/), written in C++ and is
compatible with Windows and Linux. SQL needed for database support both
MySQL and PostgreSQL.

This script library provides unique scripts for NPCs, gameobjects, events
and other that need unique implementation.

Once ScriptDev2 is compiled it is automatically run by MaNGOS on server
startup.

For further information on ScriptDev2, please visit our project web site
at http://www.scriptdev2.com/

Documentation on various development related topics can be found in the
../doc/ sub directory as well as on the web site.

The required SQL files for creating the database backend are included in
the ../sql/ sub directory. If you are updating from an older ScriptDev2
version, make sure to take a look at the SQL files provided in the
../sql/updates/ sub directory.
