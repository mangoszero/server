VANILLA WOW BRANCH
===
### A World of Warcraft server for Vanilla WoW  
----
*Mangos* is open source project, built in [C++][7], it's fast, runs on multiple
platforms, can store game data in [MySQL][40] and [PostgreSQL][42]. It also has
optional support for SOAP, and aims to be 100% compatible with [World of Warcraft][2]
in its vanilla versions, namely [patch 1.12.1][5] and [patch 1.12.2][6].

If you liked the first incarnation of [World of Warcraft][2] and still want to play
[vanilla WoW][4], this is the branch for you. We provide an authentication
server where you can manage your users, and a world server which serves game
content just like the original did back then.

On top of that each update is built by [Travis CI][16] as you can see by the
image next to the chapter's heading! We do love green builds, and working things.
To complement this, we push builds through [Coverity][17] to find and fix any
possible security issues.

World of Warcraft, and all World of Warcraft or Warcraft art, images, and lore are
copyrighted by [Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.][1]

Requirements
------------
The *Mangos* server supports a wide range of operating systems, and various
compiler platforms. In order to do that, we use various free cross-platform
libraries and use [CMake][19] to provide a cross-platform build system which
adapts to your chosen operating system and compiler.

Operating systems
-----------------
Currently we support running *Mangos* on these operating systems:

* **Windows**, 32 bit and 64 bit. [Windows][20] Server 2008 (or newer) or Windows 7 (or newer) is recommended.
* **Linux**, 32 bit and 64 bit. [Debian 7][21] and [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS][22] are
  recommended. Other distributions with similar package versions will work, too.
* **BSD**, 32 bit and 64 bit. [FreeBSD][23], [NetBSD][24], [OpenBSD][25] and
  [DragonFly][26] are recommended.

Of course, newer versions should work, too. In the case of Windows, matching
server versions will work, too.

Compilers
---------
Building *Mangos* is currently possible with these compilers:

* **Microsoft Visual Studio (Express[^1])**, 32 bit and 64 bit. Both
  [Visual Studio][30] and the Express editions of [Visual Studio][31] are
  supported. Only Visual Studio 2012 and above are now officially supported.

* **Microsoft Windows SDK**, 32 bit and 64 bit. The [Windows 7 SDK][32] is
  recommended, as older versions lack compiler features required to build
  the server.
* **Clang**, 32 bit and 64 bit. The [Clang compiler][33] can be used on any
  supported operating system.[^2]

Dependencies
------------
The *Mangos* server stands on the shoulders of well-known Open Source
libraries, and a few awesome, but less known libraries to prevent us from
inventing the wheel again.

*Please note that Linux and Mac OS X users should install packages using
their systems package management instead of source packages.*

* **MySQL** / **PostgreSQL**: to store content, and user data, we rely on
  [MySQL][40]/[MariaDB][41] and [PostgreSQL][42] to handle data.
* **ACE**: the [ADAPTIVE Communication Environment][43] aka. *ACE* provides us
  with a solid cross-platform framework for abstracting operating system
  specific details.
* **Recast**: in order to create navigation data from the client's map files,
  we use [Recast][44] to do the dirty work. It provides functions for
  rendering, pathing, etc.
* **G3D**: the [G3D][45] engine provides the basic framework for handling 3D
  data, and is used to handle basic map data.
* **libmpq**: [libmpq][46] provides an abstraction layer for reading from the
  client's data files.
* **Zlib**: [Zlib][53] ([Zlib for Windows][51]) provides compression algorithms
  used in both MPQ archive handling and the client/server protocol.
* **Bzip2**: [Bzip2][54] ([Bzip2 for Windows][52]) provides compression
  algorithms used in MPQ archives.
* **OpenSSL**: [OpenSSL][48] ([OpenSSL for Windows][55]) provides encryption
  algorithms used when authenticating clients.
* **Lua**: [Lua 5.2][56] ([Lua 5.2 for Windows][57]) provides a convenient, fast
  scripting environment, which allows us to make live changes to scripted
  content.

*ACE*, *Recast*, *G3D* and *libmpq* are included in the *Mangos* distribution as
we rely on specific versions.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

* **Doxygen**: if you want to export HTML or PDF formatted documentation for the
  *Mangos* API, you should install [Doxygen][49].
* **Lua**: if you want to test drive how *Mangos* feels with [Lua][50] as
  scripting language instead of the scripting library, you will need Lua **5.2.3**
  installed. Although an internal version is included.

Discuss
-------
If you need help with building and installing *Mangos* there are thousands of
users out there already running *Mangos* and many more you can find on our
project website and discussion forum to assist with any issues you may have.

[^1]: Visual Studio Express versions prior to the 2012 release can only
      build 32 bit applications, unless you install the Windows SDK.
[^2]: Clang support for Windows is experimental. Failure to compile Mangos
      may also relate to the experimental state of the port.
