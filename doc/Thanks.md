THANKS
------
MaNGOS has originally been written by *TeamPython*, *Wow Python* and *WoWd* teams.
Many people further contributed to MaNGOS by reporting problems, suggesting various
improvements or submitting actual code.

Special thanks should also go out to the WowwoW team. We have gained help from
them many times in the creation of this project. Keep up the good work guys.

Thanks should also go out to the Ludmilla team, who are also providing the
community with a great server. We have not gained too much help from them,
but we have received some.

Thanks to WCell team (especially Ralek) for research on realm reconnect sequence,
item scaling stats algorithm, game object rotation issues.

We would also like to acknowledge the contributions made by the following
teams, those input and code has from time to time been included in the MaNGOS
code.

Each of the commits will attempt to clearly identify the author.
